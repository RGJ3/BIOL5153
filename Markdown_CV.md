### **PREVIOUSLY COORDINATED STUDIES - Baltimore VA Medical Center**

#### **PI: Odessa Addison & Steven J. Prior**

Project Title: Assessment of Physical Function in Peripheral Arterial Disease.

Use of a battery of questionnaires, physical
function assessments, and bilateral arterial brachial index measurements to
detect and measure the effects of peripheral arterial disease on quality of
life and physical function, including but not limited to, locomotion and
activities of daily living.

#### **PI: Odessa Addison & Steven J. Prior**

Project Title: Activity to Improve Outcomes in Peripheral Arterial Disease.


Measure longitudinal outcomes of cardiovascular
exercise, resistance training, neuromuscular stimulation, dietary counseling,
and the combined use of aforementioned interventions on quality of life and
physical function in a geriatric population with peripheral arterial disease.

#### **PI: Odessa Addison & Steven J. Prior**

Project Title: Increasing Muscle Capillarization to Enhance Responses to Strength Training in Sarcopenia.

Determine whether increasing skeletal muscle
capillarization through aerobic exercise will enhance hypertrophic adaptations
to strength training in older adults with Sarcopenia.

#### **PI: Joseph Barton**

Project Title: An Engineering-Based Balance Assessment and Training Platform.

Development of a more comprehensive tool to
effectively diagnose and treat balance disorders through experimental protocols
and analytical models capable of identifying the balance system’s structure and
quantitatively assessing the functions and interactions of its elements.

#### **PI: Joseph Barton**

Project Title: A Balanced Reach Training Platform to Address Balance Disorders in Older and Neurologically Disabled Veterans NMES.

Compares the novel balance assessment and
training platform developed by Dr. Joseph Barton to proven clinical tools to
improve protocols and directives for the diagnosis and treatment of movement
coordination problems and balance-associated posture.

#### **PI: Michael Harris-Love**

Project Title: Detection of Strength Deficits
During Telerehabilitation Using Low-Cost Smartphone Medical Diagnostics.


Implement a low-cost smartphone grip strength
and rapid questionnaire self-assessment to identify Veterans with secondary
sarcopenia due to COVID-19 and chronic conditions. Positive test findings will
initiate a full assessment for rehabilitative intervention to prevent
disablement associated with musculoskeletal deficits.
